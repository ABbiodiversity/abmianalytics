# TODO

Coefs

- DONE - Bare, SnowIce: 0 and placeholder
- DONE - HFor coef in the south: use 0
- DONE - heads up for 150m mammal and amphibian models
- IN PROGRESS - add habitat elements: WAIT for revision in south
- IN PROGRESS - add Mammals: WAIT for revision in south
- N/S use-avail numbers and plots

Preds

- DONE - incorporate HFor/Bare/SnowIce into prediction code
- DONE - include wN based on pFor
- DONE - develop alternative code (current only) for bootstrap
- DONE - check rownames for outputs: C should be complete kgrid but it is not (drop subsetting?)
- DONE - make maps (cr, rf, df)
- DONE - summarize N/S SEffects

Uncertainty

- cr sd map
- ???

Wrap up

- Images to sc-dev
- Species lookup tables to finalzie
- Bio browser tables to organize
- c4i decisions (how to present, how much)


c4i

- create B=1, B=100 (250?) versions, and pull depending on boot=T/F
- store LCL/UCL besides the coefs for the plots
- Plotting coefs and prediction coefs might be separate (~marginal/joint)
