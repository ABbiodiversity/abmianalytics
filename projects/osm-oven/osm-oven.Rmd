# Introduction

The Ovenbird (_Seiurus aurocapilla_; Figure \@ref(fig:oven)) is a small but loud insectivorous songbird found throughout forested regions of Alberta, 
preferring mature/old hardwood and mixedwood forests for nesting[^1].
Ovenbirds have a relatively wide breeding range that spreads from eastern British Columbia to Quebec and Newfoundland. It is migratory species wintering in Mexico, Central America, Florida, and the Caribbean 
islands[^2].

Its conservation status is secure based on AB Wildlife Act and AEP general status 2015.
Ovenbirds have become a model organism for understanding the effects of habitat fragmentation and 
forest harvest on songbirds.
We chose this species as an example because it is one of the most studied boreal songbird species,
and it represents upland bird communities preferring mature and old grofth forests.

## Bird data

```{r include=FALSE}
ROOT <- "d:/abmi/AB_data_v2018/data/analysis/birds" # change this bit

```

We used `r nrow(en$DAT)` point count survey visits from `r nlevels(droplevels(en$DAT$SS))` unique survey stations in the Boreal, Foothills, Parklands, and Rocky Mountain natural regions north of 50 degrees latitude in Alberta, Canada. Survey data were collated from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) (`r sum(en$DAT$PCODE == "BBSAB")` visits), Boreal Avian Modelling Program (`r sum(!(en$DAT$PCODE %in% c("BBSAB", "ABMIRF", "ABMISM")))` visits; http://www.borealbirds.ca), and the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (`r sum(en$DAT$PCODE %in% c("ABMIRF", "ABMISM"))` visits; http://www.abmi.ca). Surveys were conducted between 1997 and 2017. In combination, these surveys are representative of Alberta’s boreal region. Each survey was 3--10 minutes long and sampled a radius of 50 m to unlimited distance. One or more Ovenbirds were detected during `r sum(en$YY[,"OVEN"]>0)` (`r round(100*sum(en$YY[,"OVEN"]>0)/nrow(en$YY), 1)`%) surveys, with a maximum record of `r max(en$YY[,"OVEN"])` individuals in a survey.

## Biophysical attributes

We used two spatial scales to derive predictor variables for each survey station. Local-scale variables were assessed in a 150-m radius of each station. This scale encompasses the average breeding territory of Ovenbird (1 ha[^3]) and the effective detection distance for the song of most forest songbirds[^4]. It is also half the minimum distance between stations in our data set. Stand-scale variables were assessed in a 564-m radius (1 km$^2$) of each survey station. This stand scale was chosen for pragmatic reasons to match the mapping unit in our predictions and because it roughly corresponds to the scale deemed most appropriate for landscape variables based on smoothing kernel estimates for landscape variables[^7] and based on Ovenbirds shown to disperse up to 500 m from their natal territory post-fledge, suggesting habitat selection may also be operating at this scale[^8].

At the local scale, land cover was assessed for each survey station using provincial land cover[^9][^11] information. Vegetation type included deciduous, mixedwood, white spruce, pine, black spruce forest stands, treed fen, shrub, grass/herb, graminoid fen, marsh, and swamp cover types. Human footprint was assessed at each survey point based on the year of sampling (interpreted at a 1:5000 scale[^10][^11]). Footprint type included cultivation, forestry, urban-industrial (mines, well sites, urban areas, industrial, rural residential), hard linear (road and rails), and vegetated soft linear (seismic lines, pipe lines, power lines, road verges) features.

Proportional area was calculated at the local scale, and the dominant vegetation type was assigned to each survey station based on a simple majority rule. Observations were weighted according to the proportion of the dominant land-cover type (weight = 1 for > 0.75, linearly deceasing between 0.75 and 0.25, 0 for < 0.25 proportions) to reduce the effects of 'contamination' when surveys were done in a mixture of different land-cover types. We used various data sources[^9] to estimate the years since last disturbance (i.e., forest age) relative to year of sampling for birds. Age was calculated as the area weighted average of the polygons within each buffer distance (local and stand scales).We modeled the effect of forest age on Ovenbird density by using weighted age and its quadratic and square root transformed terms as covariates. We incorporated interactions between forest type and age. When the dominant land cover was a harvest block, the predisturbance vegetation type was assumed based on available forest inventory data in the local 150-m buffer. Doing so treated harvested areas as young forest rather than a separate land cover type. We also created a contrast variable that ranged between 1 (recent harvest) and 0 (converged to natural stands) to describe the convergence trajectory of forestry cut blocks. We assumed that convergence is complete at 60 years after harvest. This allowed us to differentiate young forests of natural (i.e., fire) versus anthropogenic (i.e., timber harvest) origin.

**FIXME** add harvest trajectory convergence info.

Footprint types were treated as landcover classes when they comprised the dominant class in the buffer. However, because linear features usually make up <20% of the 150-m buffer area, we did not treat these features as separate land-cover classes. Instead we included the proportion of soft linear features within the buffer as a covariate. We used a binary variable to distinguish roadside (1) from off-road (0) surveys because it is known that their presence can introduce biases when not accounted for[^12][^13].

We also accounted for biases related to survey methodology. The majority of the surveys were done by trained human observers, whereas the remainder were field-based recordings (RiverFork and SongMeter units), which were transcribed in the laboratory. We used a three-level (human, RiverFork, SongMeter) factor variable to account for this possible bias in our analyses. The exponent of these estimated contrasts gave the magnitude of expected counts compared with the reference type of survey method[^14][^15].

Geographic variation was captured by including latitude, longitude, and climate (mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, potential evapotranspiration, annual heat moisture index, frost-free period, mean warmest and coldest month temperature[^17]), and the amount of open water in a 1-km$^2$ buffer around each survey location as another spatial covariate.

At the stand scale, we calculated the proportion of SSH within a 564 m radius of each survey station. 

**FIXME** add here how SSH were derived and selection frequencies ("Decid"      "DecidO"     "Mixedwood"  "MixedwoodO" "Spruce").

Area of total human footprint was also quantified at the stand scale for each survey station, and further partitioned as proportion of successional, alienating, linear, nonlinear, cultivation, and non-cultivation footprints. Successional footprint included activities where the soil disturbance was minimal (forest harvest, soft linear features), whereas alienating footprint included activities that disturbed soils (cultivation, urban-industrial, hard linear features, human-created water bodies). 



## Modeling

We used Poisson generalized linear models with a log link. The response variable was the number of Ovenbirds counted per survey. We used the QPAD approach to account for differences in sampling protocol and nuisance parameters affecting detectability (time of day, time of year, tree cover, habitat composition[^18][^19]). This approach converts sampling distances and durations to a common standard through statistical offsets and adjusts for differences in detection error and sampling area related to broad vegetation types and timing of surveys. The QPAD correction included time-varying singing rate estimates[^20]. Singing rates were used to estimate the probability of a Ovenbird being present and giving a cue that could be counted by the observer. We also calculated an effective detection radius (EDR) that uses distance sampling to determine the area sampled. EDRs are dependent on tree cover and habitat composition at the survey point[^18].

We applied branching forward stepwise variable selection[^5][^21] to minimize bias and variance in predictionsbased on an a priori branching hierarchy. The branching process was applied instead of a simple add-one type of variable search to make variable selection computationally more efficient by narrowing the scope of potential predictors entering the active set at each stage. At each stage of the branching hierarchy, we compared support among candidate models using Akaike's information criterion. Variables for the top-ranked model in a given stage were fixed and added to models in the subsequent stage. Model sets at each stage also considered a null model, which was the top model from the previous level or, in the case of the first stage, a constant density model without covariates. We includes the following stages:

1. Local scale land cover
2. Forest age
3. Forest harvest
4. Roadside effects
5. Methodology (human, recording units)
6. Proportion of water in surrounding 1 km$^2$
7. Space and climate variable effects
8. Proportion of suitable habitat in surrounding 1 km$^2$
9. Proportion of human footprint in surrounding 1 km$^2$

The model selection procedure was repeated by combining the branching process with bootstrap aggregation (bagging[^22], or bootstrap smoothing[^23]). Bootstrap replicates were drawn with replacement from each spatio-temporal block to ensure representation of the entire sample distribution. Temporal blocks were set using five-year intervals over the two decades of the study. Spatial blocks were defined based on natural regions (Foothills, Parkland, Rocky Mountain, Boreal). Because of its comparatively large area, the Boreal natural region (including the Canadian Shield) was further subdivided into four quadrants by the 56.5 parallel and the -115.5 meridian. Within spatial units, we sampled survey stations and survey visits within each selected station with replacement, to retain the spatial sampling pattern of the surveys in the bootstrap samples. When more than one visit occurred at the same location in the same year, we randomly selected a single visit for each of the bootstrap iterations. Observations were assumed to be independent, conditional on the value of the predictors. The number of bootstrap iterations was 239, plus the original model fit with all data, for a total of 240 independent runs.

We used 90% of the unique location-year combinations in the data as a training set and held out the remaining 10% of the data as a validation set. We calculated the bootstrap averaged (B = 240) prediction for each data point in the validation set given the values of the predictors, including the QPAD offsets. We then constructed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves by plotting sensitivity and specificity based on the predicted values and the dichotomized observations (detection vs. nondetection) to assess model performance. We calculated area under the curve (AUC) as a measure of classification accuracy.

We used the R language[^24] for data processing[^25], analysis (glm function), and prediction. The QPAD methodology was based on estimates using the detect R package[^26].

## Prediction

We summarized provincial land cover information[^27] (human footprint interpreted at a 1:15,000 scale based on ABMI's 2016 wall-to-wall human footprint inventory) for the entire study area and calculated average Ovenbird density (males per ha) for each of 1 km$^2$ units in Alberta. Stand-level attributes (footprint and forest composition) were calculated for each unit based on all polygon attributes found within that unit. The centroid of the unit was used to assign latitude, longitude, and climate variable values. Local-scale variables were determined for each stand type–age polygon within each 1 km$^2$ unit using the same approach applied for the 150-m radius buffers. Predicted Ovenbird density for each 1 km$^2$ unit was the area-weighted average of the polygon-level densities. This procedure was repeated for all 240 bootstrap runs using the estimated coefficient matrix. Point prediction for each 1 km$^2$ unit was calculated as the mean of the 240 predicted values. We calculated the coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean across bootstrap runs) for each unit as an estimate of prediction uncertainty.

## Attributing effects to industrial sectors

We used the Ovenbird models and predictions to estimate the effects of individual industrial sectors (or a set of human footprint categories) within the Oil Sands Region.We started with a summary of all combinations of vegetation types x footprint types in each 1 km$^2$ unit, for both the current (footprint included) and reference (backfilled, no footprint[^9]) conditions.  We could then 'turn on' only the footprint types associated with one industrial sector and compared the predicted abundances of each species with only that footprint type in the current land-base to the specie's predicted abundance under reference land-base. This showed the degree to which the footprint from just that one industrial sector was predicted to have changed the abundance of that species[^28][^29]. We did this calculation for each major industrial sectors (agriculture, forestry, energy, rural/urban and transportation), and also for individual footprint types related to energy sector (access roads, seismic lines, industrial facilities, well sites, mines, pipe lines).

[^28]: Solymos, P., Mahon, C. L., Fontaine, T., and Bayne, E. M. (2015). Predictive models for estimating the cumulative effects of human development on migratory landbirds in the oil sands areas of Alberta. Technical report, Joint Oil Sands Monitoring: Cause-Effects Assessment of Oil Sands Activity on Migratory Landbirds, Edmonton, AB. pp. 38+410 appendices.

[^29]: Solymos, P. & Schieck, J. (2016): Effects of industrial sectors on species abundance in Alberta. ABMI Science Letters, Issue 5, October, 2016.

The procedure gave the predicted total population effect of the industrial sector on each species' abundance within the region (including native vegetation and footprint land cover types), and the effect per unit area of the industry's footprint (i.e., how "intensive" the effect of the industry's footprint is on the species, we call this the "unit effect"). We also quantified how the predicted abundance inside the human footprint polygons compared betwen current and reference conditions, i.e. how the local abundance under current footprint changed (we call this "under-footprint" effect).

Sector effects on a species are plotted as the product of 1) the area of the sector's footprint (width of the bars), and 2) the average "per unit area" effect of that sector's footprint on the species (height of the bars). The area of footprint for a sector is the sum of all footprints belonging to it. The average effect of a sector is the difference between the predicted current and reference abundances in that sector's footprint type based on the species' model. A bar with a large area means that that sector has had a large effect on the population --- increasing the population if the bar is above 0, decreasing it if the bar is below 0.

The effect of an industrial sector on a species is affected by three factors: 1) How much area is occupied by footprint of that sector, 2) How strongly -- positively or negatively, or a mix of both -- the species responds to each of the sector's footprint types, 3) How much of the sector's footprint is in higher- versus lower-quality habitat for the species. For example, a species that lives in old upland forest may be more affected by the forestry sector than the energy sector, because forestry focuses disturbance on older merchantable stands.

Tables are separately presented for the North (foothills, Canadian shield, boreal excluding the Dry Mixedwood subregion) and South (grassland, parkland, Dry Mixedwood subregion of the boreal) study regions including the total population effect (area of rectangles) and the "unit-effect" (y-axis value) for the different sectors (columns) per species (rows; http://species.abmi.ca). The percent of human footprint in the North and South analyses regions are:

We cannot tell which roads are associated with particular sectors (for example roads to well sites in forestry cutblocks). Thus all roads are attributed to the transportation sector. Two sectors sometimes operate together to reduce cumulative effects, such as forestry cutblocks being placed where energy developments are planned. A forestry cutblock on a future wellsite, for example, would be assigned to forestry until the wellpad was built, when that area of footprint would change to the energy sector. In addition, we have difficulty separating some types of footprint, such as urban and industrial areas, so those types are assigned to only one sector. 

Sector effects only include direct effects of footprint, not indirect effects (e.g., pollution, noise, access effects) or possible cumulative effects where two or more sectors interact (e.g., roads allowing weeds into an area, where they can then colonize harvest areas).

## Comparing direct impacts

Additive sector effects: talk about regional, under HF, and unit effects here

## Landscape level effects

Show SSH and km_HF results based on actual landscapes from prediction

## Direct and indirect impacts

Bit unclear yet what to do here


# Conclusion
