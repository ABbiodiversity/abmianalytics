# Introduction

The `r INFO$name` (_`r INFO$sci`_) is a `r INFO$descr`.
Its conservation status is `r INFO$status` based on AB Wildlife Act and AEP general status 2015 `r INFO$comment`
`r INFO$motivation`

# Methods

Methods closely follow the approach described in Ball et al. (2016) and Solymos et al. (2019, 2020).

## Bird data

We used 143,537 point count survey visits from 33,562 unique survey stations in the Boreal, Foothills, Parklands, and Rocky Mountain natural regions north of 50 degrees latitude in Alberta, Canada. Survey data were collated from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) (41,936 visits), Boreal Avian Modelling Program (79,804 visits; http://www.borealbirds.ca), and the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (21,797 visits; http://www.abmi.ca). Surveys were conducted between 1997 and 2019. In combination, these surveys are representative of Albertaâ€™s boreal region. Each survey was 3--10 minutes long and sampled a radius of 50 m to unlimited distance. One or more `r INFO$name`s were detected during `r INFO$occ` (`r round(100*INFO$occ/143537, 1)`%) surveys (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-det)).

```{r plot-det,fig.cap=paste('Map of detections for', INFO$name, 'in Alberta, aggregated at 10 km x 10 km resolution. Background colors indicate Naturel Regions, grey pixles refer to areas where bird sampling has occurred, red pixels are detections.'),out.width='50%'}

```

## Biophysical attributes

We used two spatial scales to derive predictor variables for each survey station. Local-scale variables were assessed in a 150-m radius of each station. This scale encompasses the average breeding territory and the effective detection distance for the song of most landbirds (Matsuoka et al. 2012).

At the local scale, land cover was assessed for each survey station using provincial land cover (ABMI 2017, Allen et al. 2019) information. Vegetation type included deciduous, mixedwood, white spruce, pine, black spruce forest stands, treed fen, shrub, grass/herb, graminoid fen, marsh, and swamp cover types. Human footprint was assessed at each survey point based on the year of sampling (interpreted at a 1:5000 scale; Allen et al. 2019, Schieck et al. 2014). Footprint type included cultivation, forestry, urban-industrial (mines, well sites, urban areas, industrial, rural residential), hard linear (road and rails), and vegetated soft linear (seismic lines, pipe lines, power lines, road verges) features.

Proportional area of the land cover types was calculated at the local scale, and the dominant vegetation type was assigned to each survey station based on a simple majority rule. Observations were weighted according to the proportion of the dominant land-cover type (weight = 1 for > 0.75, linearly deceasing between 0.75 and 0.25, 0 for < 0.25 proportions) to reduce the effects of 'contamination' when surveys were done in a mixture of different land-cover types. We used various data sources (ABMI 2017) to estimate the years since last disturbance (i.e., forest age) relative to year of sampling for birds. Age was calculated as the area weighted average of the polygons within each buffer distance (local and stand scales).

We modeled the effect of forest age on `r INFO$name` density by using weighted age and its quadratic and square root transformed terms as covariates and selected the better fit. We incorporated interactions between forest type and age. When the dominant land cover was a harvest block, the pre-disturbance vegetation type but not age was assumed based on available forest inventory data in the local 150-m buffer. Doing so treated harvested areas as young forest rather than a separate land cover type. We also created a contrast variable that ranged between 1 (recent harvest) and 0 (converged to natural stands) to describe the convergence trajectory of forestry cut blocks (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-recovery)). We assumed that convergence is complete at 60 years after harvest. This allowed us to differentiate young forests of natural (i.e., fire) versus anthropogenic (i.e., timber harvest) origin.

    82.7, 87, 90.1, 92.3, 94, 95.3, 96.7, 98.2, 100)/100

    88.3, 90.5, 92, 93, 94, 95.1, 96.4, 97.6, 98.8, 100)/100
matplot(age*200, cbind(conif, decid), type="l", lty=1, col=c(2,4),
  xlab="Age (years)", ylab="Recovery")
legend("topright", bty="n", title="Stand type", lty=1, col=c(2,4),
  legend=c("Coniferous", "Mixed/Deciduous"))
```

Footprint types were treated as landcover classes when they comprised the dominant class in the buffer. However, because linear features usually make up <20% of the 150-m buffer area, we did not treat these features as separate land-cover classes. Instead we included the proportion of soft linear features within the buffer as a covariate. We used a binary variable to distinguish roadside (1) from off-road (0) surveys because it is known that their presence can introduce biases when not accounted for (Bayne et al. 2016, Marques et al. 2010). 

We also accounted for biases related to survey methodology. The majority of the surveys were done by trained human observers, whereas the remainder were field-based recordings (RiverFork and SongMeter units), which were transcribed in the laboratory. We used a three-level (human, RiverFork, SongMeter) factor variable to account for this possible bias in our analyses. The exponent of these estimated contrasts gave the magnitude of expected counts compared with the reference type of survey method (Van Wilgenburg et al. 2017, Yip et al. 2017).

Geographic variation was captured by including latitude, longitude, and climate (mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, potential evapotranspiration, annual heat moisture index, frost-free period, mean warmest and coldest month temperature; Wang et al. 2012), and the amount of open water in a 1-km$^2$ buffer around each survey location as another spatial covariate.

## Modeling

We used Poisson generalized linear models with a log link. The response variable was the number of `r INFO$name`s counted per survey. We used the QPAD approach to account for differences in sampling protocol and nuisance parameters affecting detectability (time of day, time of year, tree cover, habitat composition; Solymos et al. 2013, Solymos 2016). This approach converts sampling distances and durations to a common standard through statistical offsets and adjusts for differences in detection error and sampling area related to broad vegetation types and timing of surveys. The QPAD correction included time-varying singing rate estimates (Solymos et al. 2018a). Singing rates were used to estimate the probability of a `r INFO$name` being present and giving a cue that could be counted by the observer. We also calculated an effective detection radius (EDR) that uses distance sampling to determine the area sampled. EDRs are dependent on tree cover and habitat composition at the survey point (Solymos et al. 2013). Overall, this allowed us to estimate the density (number of singing males per hectare).

We applied branching forward stepwise variable selection (Ball et al. 2016, Westwood et al. 2019) to minimize bias and variance in predictions based on an _a priori_ branching hierarchy. The branching process was applied instead of a simple add-one type of variable search to make variable selection computationally more efficient by narrowing the scope of potential predictors entering the active set at each stage. At each stage of the branching hierarchy, we compared support among candidate models using Akaike's information criterion. Variables for the top-ranked model in a given stage were fixed and added to models in the subsequent stage. Model sets at each stage also considered a null model, which was the top model from the previous level or, in the case of the first stage, a constant density model without covariates.

We includes the following stages:
(1) Local scale land cover,
(2) Forest age,
(3) Forest harvest,
(4) Roadside effects,
(5) Methodology (human, recording units),
(6) Proportion of water in surrounding 1 km$^2$,
(7) Space and climate variable effects.

The model selection procedure was repeated by combining the branching process with bootstrap aggregation (bagging [Breiman 1996], or bootstrap smoothing [Efron 2014]). Bootstrap replicates were drawn with replacement from each spatio-temporal block to ensure representation of the entire sample distribution. Temporal blocks were set using five-year intervals over the two decades of the study. Spatial blocks were defined based on natural regions (Foothills, Parkland, Rocky Mountain, Boreal). Because of its comparatively large area, the Boreal natural region (including the Canadian Shield) was further subdivided into four quadrants by the 56.5 parallel and the -115.5 meridian. Within spatial units, we sampled survey stations and survey visits within each selected station with replacement, to retain the spatial sampling pattern of the surveys in the bootstrap samples. When more than one visit occurred at the same location in the same year, we randomly selected a single visit for each of the bootstrap iterations. Observations were assumed to be independent, conditional on the value of the predictors. The number of bootstrap iterations was 239, plus the original model fit with all data, for a total of 256 independent runs.

We calculated the bootstrap averaged (B = 256) prediction for each data point in the validation set given the values of the predictors, including the QPAD offsets. We then constructed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves by plotting sensitivity and specificity based on the predicted values and the dichotomized observations (detection vs. nondetection) to assess model performance. We calculated area under the curve (AUC) as a measure of classification accuracy.

We used the R language (R Core Team 2019) for data processing (Solymos 2009), analysis (glm function), and prediction. The QPAD methodology was based on estimates using the detect R package (Solymos et al. 2018b).

## Prediction

We summarized provincial land cover information (ABMI 2018) (human footprint interpreted at a 1:15,000 scale based on ABMI's 2018 wall-to-wall human footprint inventory) for the entire study area and calculated average `r INFO$name` density (males per ha) for each of 1 km$^2$ units in Alberta. The centroid of the unit was used to assign latitude, longitude, and climate variable values. Local-scale variables were determined for each stand typeâ€“age polygon within each 1 km$^2$ unit using the same approach applied for the 150-m radius buffers. Predicted `r INFO$name` density for each 1 km$^2$ unit was the area-weighted average of the polygon-level densities. This procedure was repeated for all 256 bootstrap runs using the estimated coefficient matrix. Point prediction for each 1 km$^2$ unit was calculated as the mean of the 256 predicted values. We calculated the standard deviation (SD) and inter-quartile range (IQR) for each unit as an estimate of prediction uncertainty.

## Attributing effects to industrial sectors

We used the `r INFO$name` models and predictions to estimate the effects of individual industrial sectors (or a set of human footprint categories) within the Oil Sands Region. We started with a summary of all combinations of vegetation types x footprint types in each 1 km$^2$ unit, for both the current (footprint included) and reference (backfilled, no footprint; ABMI 2017) conditions.  We could then 'turn on' only the footprint types associated with one industrial sector and compared the predicted abundances with only that footprint type in the current land-base to the `r INFO$name`'s predicted abundance under reference land-base. This showed the degree to which the footprint from just that one industrial sector was predicted to have changed the abundance of `r INFO$name` (Solymos et al. 2015, Solymos and Schieck 2016). We did this calculation for each major industrial sectors (agriculture, forestry, energy, rural/urban and transportation), and also for individual footprint types related to energy sector (access roads, seismic lines, industrial facilities, well sites, mines, pipe lines). In other words, the regression coefficients from our models were used to compute the change in `r INFO$name` abundance on average from each type of disturbance (Figure \@ref(fig:s4t)).

The procedure gave the predicted total population effect of the industrial sector on `r INFO$name` abundance within the region (including native vegetation and footprint land cover types), and the effect per unit area of the industry's footprint (i.e., how "intensive" the effect of the industry's footprint is on `r INFO$name`s, we call this the "unit effect"). We also quantified how the predicted abundance inside the human footprint polygons compared between current and reference conditions, i.e. how the local abundance under current footprint changed (we call this "under-footprint" effect).

The effect of an industrial sector is affected by three factors: 1) How much area is occupied by footprint of that sector, 2) How strongly -- positively or negatively, or a mix of both -- the species responds to each of the sector's footprint types, 3) How much of the sector's footprint is in higher- versus lower-quality habitat for the species. For example, `r INFO$name` that lives in old upland forest may be more affected by the forestry sector than the energy sector, because forestry focuses disturbance on older merchantable stands.

We cannot tell which roads are associated with particular sectors (for example roads to well sites in forestry cutblocks). Thus, all roads are attributed to the transportation sector. Two sectors sometimes operate together to reduce cumulative effects, such as forestry cutblocks being placed where energy developments are planned. A forestry cutblock on a future wellsite, for example, would be assigned to forestry until the wellpad was built, when that area of footprint would change to the energy sector. In addition, we have difficulty separating some types of footprint, such as urban and industrial areas, so those types are assigned to only one sector. 

Sector effects only include direct effects of footprint, not indirect effects (e.g., pollution, noise, access effects) or possible cumulative effects where two or more sectors interact (e.g., roads allowing weeds into an area, where they can then colonize harvest areas). In this report, we describe the results from studies that address these issues for the `r INFO$name`.

# Results

## Habitat associations and spatial distribution

__FIXME Describe what we see in the plot here__

`r INFO$name` abundance was highest in mature deciduous and mixed deciduous/coniferous forest stands, supporting 0.35-0.75 males / ha on average. Upland white spruce dominated coniferous stands support intermediate population densities (0.15-0.35 males / ha). Pine dominated upland forests and treed wetlands (black spruce bogs, larch dominated treed fens), open wetlands, and human footprint types all proved to be unsuitable for `r INFO$name`s (<0.15 males / ha; Figures \@ref(fig:plot-hab) and \@ref(fig:plot-lin)). Uncertainty around these estimates was very small compared to the effect sizes. `r INFO$name` abundances in fire and harvest originated stands of the same age did differ significantly from each other. The species generally avoided young forests irrespective of forest origin.
The spatial distribution of `r INFO$name` in Alberta followed the distribution of deciduous and mixedwood forests outside of the Grasslands natural region and higher elevations areas (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-cr)).

## Local scale footprint impacts

### Paired control-treatment studies

__FIXME this paragraph needs editing for individual species: what can we see in the figure?__

Bayne et al. (2016) studied bird responses to wellpads, pipelines, and seismic lines using a paired sampling design to estimate impact ratios (treatment / control). They found that `r INFO$name` abundance in 50-m count radius was 80% of the control abundance found in forests 150--400 m from the nearest seismic line edge. This effects was not significant due to the noisy nature of bird counts collected over small areas (50-m radius is 0.8 ha), and counts were also likely 'contaminated' by individuals detected in the surrounding forest habitats, because seismic lines tend to be narrow (5--8 m wide) making the actual footprint less than 10% of the area sampled by the bird count. By looking at the point estimate of 80% impact ratio, it is important to note that a less than 10% habitat loss resulted in 20% abundance decrease, therefore we suspect at least half of the impact is attributable to edge effects because the loss was greater than expected based on area alone. Impact ratios were close to 1 (no effect) when using 100-m or unlimited distance counts, which minimized the relative area of the seismic line inside the surveyed area (Figure \@ref(fig:b16)). Given this complexity, we can conclude that it is difficult to estimate seismic line effects, mostly due to the narrow nature of the feature relative to counting area. Nevertheless, the two studies both point to a slight negative effect of seismic lines on `r INFO$name` abundance at the local scale.

### Model based evaluation

We summarized local scale impacts based on the provincial model incorporating local scale habitat associations and spatial and climate variables (stages 1--7). These local scale impacts can be quantified over the whole Oil Sands region by summing up the effects within the region based on predictions under current conditions (native vegetation and footprint in the landscape) and reference (backfilled and native vegetation, no footprint). 

A simple way to understand the local scale effects of land conversion, e.g. from old mixedwood to footprint is to directly compare the two coefficients (e.g. the heights of the bars in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-hab)). The problem with this is that footprint types are not strictly selective. I.e. we cannot claim that old mixedwood forest will only ever become a forestry cutblock, because it could eventually become also agriculture, wellpad, seismic line, etc. Although we think this approach is still valid in a planning context, it does not convey regional total or average impacts very effectively. Therefore, we chose to express local scale effects over the whole Oil Sands region, summarized by current footprint type, averaging over the original (reference) land cover. This implicitly weights the land conversion effects by the amount of each reference land cover type.

When we focus exclusively on areas that are encapsulated within current footprint polygons, we can talk about 'local' effects for individual energy sector footprint types. This summarizes the abundance change between current and reference landscapes inside the boundaries of the footprint polygons. This refers to a regional average of the impacts due to land cover transformation from native vegetation to a given footprint type without regard to other footprint types and native vegetation (areas outside of any current footprint).

The 'regional' effects summarizes the abundance change between current and reference landscapes over the whole Oil Sands region, including native vegetation and footprint polygons. This refers to a regional average of the impacts due to land cover transformation from native vegetation to a given footprint type taking into account all other footprint types and native vegetation (areas outside of any current footprint).

The 'unit' effect is an area standardized version of the regional effect. A -100 value indicates that transforming 1% of the land base to a particular footprint type leads to a corresponding 1% loss in population abundance. Unit effects closer to 0 have less effect on population abundance, mostly because the footprint type tends to avoid suitable habitat for the species. Values that are greater than 100 in absolute value tend to disproportionately affect population abundance: 1% land cover transformation leading to >1% population change.

### Population consequences of local scale impacts

Our approach adjusts the observed counts so that the models estimate singing males per ha. This allows us to estimate the size of the `r INFO$name` population in the Oil Sands region using our predictions and a pair-adjustment that (see Solymos et al. 2020). The pair adjustment factor is 2 (Blancher et al. 2013) and adjusts for the likelihood that one member of a pair (e.g., incubating female) is not available for detection during the point count surveys. 

The estimated number of `r INFO$name`s in the Oil Sands region is `r round(NN["Curr","Mean"]/10^6, 3)` million individuals (95% confidence interval: `r round(NN["Curr","2.5%"]/10^6, 3)` -- `r round(NN["Curr","97.5%"]/10^6, 3)`) based on predictions using current landscape conditions. The estimated population size in the reference (i.e. no human footprint) landscape in the same region for `r INFO$name` is `r round(NN["Ref","Mean"]/10^6, 3)` million individuals (95% confidence interval: `r round(NN["Ref","2.5%"]/10^6, 3)` -- `r round(NN["Ref","97.5%"]/10^6, 3)`). 
The combined effect of _all_ kinds of human foorptint (forestry, energy, agriculture) in the Oil Sands region changed habitat supply for `r INFO$name` by `r round(diff(NN[,"Mean"])/10^6, 3)` million individuals.

__FIXME this section needs adjustment in wording specific to each species__

We can estimate the effects of the local scale impacts on the population in absolute terms using the reference population size estimate and the regional energy sector effects from Table \@ref(tab:setab). The total energy sector portion of lost habitat supply is `r round(median(RES$se[,"Total.Energy"]*NNN[[params$species]]["Ref",]*200/1000), 2)` thousand `r INFO$name` individuals with wide uncertainty (95% CI: `r quantile(RES$se[,"Total.Energy"]*NNN[[params$species]]["Ref",]*200/1000, 0.025)` -- `r quantile(RES$se[,"Total.Energy"]*NNN[[params$species]]["Ref",]*200/1000, 0.975)`). This number does not represents actual population loss as a consequence of oil sands development, but represents the number of individuals the landscape could have sustained without the energy sector footprint. We have very limited knowledge of the saturation of habitats on the breeding grounds (i.e. the actual population vs. carrying capacity), thus we cannot claim the all the estimated difference as population loss. If , however, habitats are saturated near carrying capacity, our models would predict a significant population consequence as a result of the energy sector development.

To put this result into a cumulative effects perspective, we can demonstrate that local scale energy sector development has a roughly proportionate effect on `r INFO$name` habitat supply when we compare the population consequences with the amount of footprint. Energy sector footprint in the Oil Sands is `r round(RES$se[1,"Area.Energy"], 2)`% of all the human footprint in the region, whereas energy footprint is responsible for `r round(mean(RES$se[,"Total.Energy"]), 2)`% of the population differences. This is, however, an average over all types of footprint. As we demonstrated in the previous sections, different energy sector activities have very different impacts on `r INFO$name` habitats and populations which needs to be and can be incorporated in land use planning.


# Conclusions

__FIXME this section needs adjustment in wording specific to each species__

This report provides an example of what the impacts of oilsands development are on the `r INFO$name`.  The `r INFO$name` is one of hundreds of bird species that can be evaluated in this way.  This report clearly shows that habitat loss and to a lesser degree habitat fragmentation and pollutants have negative effects on this species.  The `r INFO$name` is a common bird and thus there is limited concern that oilsands development will lead to regional extinction.  However, this work clearly demonstrates that the cumulative effects of oilsands and other activities are altering the size of `r INFO$name` populations in the region based on changes in habitat availability.  

The two key questions of the OSM program are: 1) how have things changed in the oilsands; and 2) are these changes caused by oilsands?  This report emphasizes the second question, in that we have studied in great detail the reaction of this species to various oilsands disturbances and an approach to adding up those effects so as to estimate the impacts on population size.  The models have been validated in a number of different ways and thus can be applied to estimate population level changes based on changes in habitat suitability and availability.

We do not demonstrate an actual temporal trend.  Much of the data used here is from focal studies that address a specific question.  We recommended that if trend is a priority that sites used in this report be revisited in a designed manner to clearly demonstrate changes over time.  The ABMI 20km by 20km grid is designed to do this and provide a representative estimate of change at a regional scale.  If more focused change over time estimates are desired (i.e. SAGD alley, mine A etc), then the locations used in this report should be revisited to determine temporal changes in a designed manner. I.e. return to sites with limited habitat change, return to sites with large change in energy footprint, return to sites with regrowth of vegetation on energy footprint.
